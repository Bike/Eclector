\section{Packages}

\subsection{Package for ordinary reader functions}

The package for ordinary reader functions is named
\texttt{eclector.reader}.  To use features of this package, we
recommend the use of explicit package prefixes, simply because this
package shadows and exports names that are also exported from the
\texttt{common-lisp} package.  Importing this package will likely
cause conflicts with the \texttt{common-lisp} package otherwise.
